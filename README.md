Omniplan2Basecamp
=================

`Omniplan2Basecamp` lets you create milestones on Basecamp, from a `.csv`
exported from [Omniplan](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omniplan/).

This should be considered an alpha release, it is extremely rough and you
should definitely have a look at the code before using.
