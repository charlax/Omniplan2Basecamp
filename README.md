Omniplan2Basecamp
=================

`Omniplan2Basecamp` lets you create milestones on Basecamp, from a `.csv`
exported from [Omniplan](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omniplan/).

This should be considered an alpha release, it is extremely rough and you
should definitely have a look at the code before using.

Usage
=====

1. Copy `config.defaults` to `config.local`
2. Update `config.local` content with the your token, Basecamp URL, etc.
3. Run `Omniplan2Basecamp.py filename.csv`

Todos
=====

* Implement update feature
* Clean the code
